<p>Create a simple Angular.js application to consume some JSON data from the RedBlueService API – a REST
service, which returns colour swatch data, including colour names and their corresponding HEX value. Your
app should have a different view for “red” and “blue” and allow the user to move between them. It should
retrieve the swatch data from the API, then display the swatch on screen.</p>
